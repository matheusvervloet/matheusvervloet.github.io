Hi everyone! I'm Matheus, a 2nd-year (as of 2021) MBA student at Chicago Booth.

This quarter I'm taking a Persuasion course and figured I should start to write more in order to put what I learn into practice. I don't know what to write about just yet, but expect to figure out soon.

Thanks for being here!
